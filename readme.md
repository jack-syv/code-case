Certain assumptions were made, I assumed the property_id is unique, and identified by "bruksnummer, bnr or g√•rdsnummer"
Furthermore the repository provides dummy methods for DB handling, and do not have any functionality.
The property_id should ideally be validated against a central registry, ensuring that the bnr exists at the supplied address or some similar solution.

In addition, some handling of lower case / uppercase strings may be necessary for unit_type and features. In addition to validation of the address, (e.g. it exists in the country)

Furthermore, some automated tests have been added, but these will fail as the dummy repository doesn't update any list or database.
